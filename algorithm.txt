1) Pull a lot of images of modern art from some place. 
2) Cast features on top of it a.k.a. 1x1 pixel blocks, 2x2 blocks, 3x3, ... 1xn blocks, nx1 blocks, nxn, etc.
3) Use a naive bayes or whatever to cast a language model on top of these features. 
4) For each pixel at time t-1(n), where an image is reshaped into a single long vector, predict t(n) with some probability.
5) To generate an art piece. Sample from all spaces.
